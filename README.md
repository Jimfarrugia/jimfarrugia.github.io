## Design Process

#### Initial Planning

Having limited time, one of the first things I did was write a [**Project Plan**](./docs/portfolio-project-plan.pdf) and a [**Timeline**](./docs/portfolio-project-timeline.pdf) for the project.

I scoped out requirements, core features and stretch goals. Then I broke up requirements and goals into tasks and put those tasks on a Trello board.

I used different colours to give tasks categories such "planning", "feature" and "documentation". I also used Trello to enter and keep track of due-dates for individual tasks so I wouldn't need to refer to the timeline document as much as I was in my previous project.

#### Colour Palette & Moodboard

The primary blue and yellow colours of the website were inherited from version 1.0 however, I used Google's materical design colour palette tool to generate additional swatches as well as test for accessibility / legibility.

I created a moodboard with some various elements that I wanted to keep from the original design, and some various references to the desired 'look and feel' of the design.

#### Wireframes

I drew wireframes for the layout on small and large screens. I also made some notes about things I wanted to include in the design. These came in handy from start to finish.

#### Logo

I spent quite a while and went through a fair few iterations to come up with this logo last year.

I like the look and feel of the logo. I designed it to synergize with the material design pattern I'd been planning to use in my portfolio. The logo was also designed with the goal of looking good in a wide variety of colours and on a wide variety of background colours.
