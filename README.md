## Design Process

### Initial Planning

Having limited time, one of the first things I did was write a [**Project Plan**](./docs/project_plan.pdf) and a [**Timeline**](./docs/project_timeline.pdf) for the project.

I scoped out requirements, core features and stretch goals. Then I broke up requirements and goals into tasks and put those tasks on a Trello board.

I used different colours to give tasks categories such "planning", "feature" and "documentation". I also used Trello to enter and keep track of due-dates for individual tasks so I wouldn't need to refer to the timeline document as much as I was in my previous project.
